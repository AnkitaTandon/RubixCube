Common Questions-

Q: why I chose this project?
A:  A hello to Strangers, thank you reading this, your a good human but this isn't worth unless u wanna have some fun.DM @CodePurble.

    To my personal human, ask the human you see in the mirror. 
   ( This simply explains how insane my brain can get when it comes to you . 
      I don't know whom to be mad at but I'm crying and no tear's coming.
      Trust me, when I run out of food I'm gonna eat you assuming you to be one big yummy pizza!!
      No courtesy for you :P)
      
 Q: Is it in executable stage?
 A: yes. No errors, you can run the program.
 
 Q: Structure of the code?
 A: Single hierarchy as in now, class Start>Cube>Load.
                 PS: class Load comprises of the main method.
